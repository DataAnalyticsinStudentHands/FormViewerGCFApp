Form Viewer App
===========

FormBuilder is a dynamic form building web application that works with dynamic forms and provides sharing functionality. It communicates to a Java Backend located in FormBuilderBackend repo.

### Getting Started
1. Run `npm install`. This uses `package.js` and install local dependencies.

1. Run `gulp setup`. This uses `Gulpfile.js` and sets up local repository.

2. Run `ionic serve`. This uses `ionic.xml` and will serve as local node server. Live updates when you make changes to the code.

### How to Build Mobile Apps
1. Run `gulp android-setup` or `gulp ios-setup` this uses the Gulpfile.js to automate cordova, plugin, and build.

2. Run `gulp android-build` or `gulp ios-build` for subsequent updates to the code and resources.

3. Run `cordova run android` or  open the `*.xcodeproj` file generated by cordova for iOS.

### Building for Production
Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/DataAnalyticsinStudentHands/DASH-Documentation/blob/master/Code%20Development/Frontend/How-to-Build-Mobile-Applications-for-Production.md), but before performing a `cordova build android --release` add [this file](https://gist.github.com/CarlSteven/3ec93b27003c3859c118) to {repo_base}\platforms\android\
